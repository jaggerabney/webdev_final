                    Undead Settlement Photography began, like many things in Lothric, with one person: me! 
                    My name is Greirat the Thief, and I’m the CEA (Chief Executive Ash) of our little company. 
                    It took a lot of work to get to where I am today, and there are a lot of stories I could tell, 
                    but it makes sense to start at the beginning of it all. 
                    <br><br>
                    Many cycles ago, I was a much different person. 
                    As my name would suggest, I was involved in much less legal activities, 
                    and to be honest, I was headed down a dark path. 
                    My lifestyle culminated in me being locked inside a prison cell, and I might’ve died, 
                    if not for a special someone. 
                    Though I never caught their name, they broke me out of that cage I found myself in 
                    - both figuratively and literally - by giving me a new purpose: photography.

                My friend sent me to many places - the Undead Settlement, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, Lothric Castle - 
                to take pictures, and it was during these times that I really honed my craft. 
                I learned of the little things that take a picture from good to great: 
                focus, color grading, composition, white balance, and so on. 
                Most importantly, I saw the many things in this world that are worth capturing, 
                igniting an ember in my heart that would never go out. 
                <br><br>
                Though my friend soon moved on, I decided to stay behind. 
                The wonders of Lothric had given me purpose, and it felt wrong to abandon them. 
                I wandered the kingdom, snapping picture after picture, 
                but there are only so many subjects within these castle walls. 
                Soon, I found myself with a passion for a craft that I could no longer do, and I felt hopeless. 
                Thankfully, my grandmother Loretta rekindled my fervor with one simple idea: start a studio!

                    Scraping up the few souls I had, 
                    I was able to rent a small office building right off the Road of Sacrifices, 
                    nestled between the Cathedral of the Deep and the Halfway Fortress. 
                    It was a nerve wracking experience - I put everything I had on the line - 
                    but good service, quality work, and a big smile paid off in the end. 
                    Now, Undead Settlement Photography is a thirty-Ash company with offices in the Undead Settlement, 
                    Lothric Castle, and the Cathedral of the Deep. 
                    We couldn’t be more happy doing what we do, 
                    and we hope that we can show you the dedication to quality, service, 
                    and friendliness that makes us the best in Lothric.
