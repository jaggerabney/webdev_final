                    Questions? We'd be happy to answer!
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <span class="question">
                        How are your pictures captured?
                    </span>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Our pictures are captured using top-of-the-line, proprietary sorcery technology. 
                    The inner workings of these spells are a company secret, so without going too far in-depth, 
                    the findings of Big Hat Logan are combined with special pairs of binoculars 
                    forged by Blacksmith Andre to create a special device that can encapsulate a moment in time. 
                    All of our photographers are more than qualified to use these devices, 
                    as our standards for lensman are among the highest in Lothric. Fun fact: 
                    we are the only photography studio in Lothric that requires a degree from Vinheim’s very own Dragon School!
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <span class="question">
                        If your cameras encapsulate moments in time, 
                        doesn’t that mean the people in my pictures are stuck in them forever?
                    </span>

                    <br><br>
                    Undead Settlement Photography abides by an unprecedented quality standard. 
                    Our photographers are trained to never capture people in their shots, 
                    and we have gone seven full cycles without any accidents! Your safety is our top concern, 
                    and we assure you that you and your loved ones will not be trapped in any pictures taken during our shoots.

                    <span class="question">
                        What is your business doing to prevent the spread of the Undead Curse?
                    </span>

                    <br><br>
                    Safety is a top priority at Undead Settlement Photography. 
                    All of our employees are tested daily for any signs of the Undead Curse as per the D.I.R.G.E. Test: 
                    discolored skin, insanity, rotten odor, grisly appearance, and enraged disposition. 
                    Additionally, all of our on-site photographers are required to carry a stack of Purging Stones 
                    to prevent infection should they come in contact with any Undead. 
                    Lastly, we carry out our commitment to our employees to the very end, 
                    executing any employees that are confirmed to have the Undead Curse. 
                    Under these guidelines, we have had only two infections in the last cycle!
