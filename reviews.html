                    After getting my eyes back, 
                    I was astounded by all the beauty that had been right in front of me. 
                    My job, however, prevents me from travelling, 
                    and knowing that I was missing out on so much really bummed me out. 
                    Fortunately, I found Undead Settlement Photography! 
                    Their photographers were able to bring the beauty to me, 
                    and it felt like my life had meaning again! 
                    Other than the Grand Betrayal, of course...did I say that out loud?

                    I used to get around a lot when I was younger 
                    - I was a part of the Undead Legion, after all! - 
                    but after settling down, 
                    it’s hard to find the time to go and visit 
                    the distant lands that my brethren and I conquered in my youth.
                    It's enough to really get a legionnaire down, you know? 
                    Thankfully, Undead Settlement Photography was able to capture the places that 
                    really bring me back - and at a price that didn’t cause me to go Hollow!

                    I was so stressed about my wedding that I wanted to tear my hair out. 
                    I had to manage my Dark Sigils, worry about my friend Horace, beat Pontiff Sulyvahn...
                    I was up to my neck in problems! When I went to Undead Settlement Photography, 
                    my stress melted away. They were helpful, supportive, 
                    and took some of the best pictures I have ever seen! I’ll never go anywhere else.
